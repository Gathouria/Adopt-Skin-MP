# Adopt & Skin (Animal Skinner)

What A&S lets you do:

- Use a suite of your own custom sprites for any animal, pet, or horse in the game

- Uses a randomized skin by default when a new animal, pet, or horse appears

- Allows adopting multiple pets

- Allows adopting multiple horses

- Call a horse to you with a hotkey

- One-tile-wide horses, for galloping anywhere you damn well please

- Compatible with [BFAV](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3296) (Both 2.2.6 and the 3.0.0 beta)

- Compatible with save files with multipets or multihorses from another mod



# To Use Adopt & Skin:

- Uninstall other mods that affect the skins of creatures. If you're using A&S on an existing save, call `randomize_creature` once in-game on the affected creatures. A&S will take over handling their skins after that.

- To use skins with A&S (including skins from those other mods you uninstalled), rename the spritesheet `.png` or `.xnb` files as described below. A few example skins are included with the download from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4011/).

- Place these properly named skins in `AdoptSkin/assets/skins`

- To use the vanilla skin for an animal instead of a custom one, just remove any skins for that creature type from the `/skins` folder

That's it! You're all set.
(Customized options can be set in the `Config` file, as described below)

# Incompatible mods:

- **More Animals -** MA competes with A&S when trying to reskin and move animals around the map, and A&S covers the functionality of MA
- **Reskin mods -** These mods compete with A&S when trying to reskin or adjust animals, and cause weird issues. A&S covers their functionality once the skins from these mods have been moved into the `AdoptSkin/assets/skins` folder.

# Sprite names:

All farm animals, pets, and horses must be one of the following types (Note on BFAV animals below):

| **Animal Type** | **Baby subtype** | **Sheared subtype**|
|---|---|---|
| BlueChicken | *BabyBlueChicken* | - |
| BrownChicken | *BabyBrownChicken* | - |
| WhiteChicken | *BabyWhiteChicken* | - |
| VoidChicken | *BabyVoidChicken* | - |
| Duck | *BabyDuck* | - |
| Rabbit | *BabyRabbit* | - |
| Dinosaur | - | - |
| BrownCow | *BabyBrownCow* | - |
| WhiteCow | *BabyWhiteCow* | - |
| Goat | *BabyGoat* | - |
| Sheep | *BabySheep* | *ShearedSheep* |
| Pig | *BabyPig* | - |
| | | |
| | | |
| **Pet Type**| - | - |
| Cat | - | - |
| Dog | - | - |
| | | |
| | | |
| **Horse Type** | - | - |
| Horse | - | - |



Sprite sheets should be named in the manner listed below and placed in the `/asses/skins` folder. If you're familiar with the way [More Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2274) names these files, it is exactly the same.

* The file must be named in the format of `[Baby/Sheared][Type]_[Skin ID]`

**EX: `Cat_1`, `BabyVoidChicken_7`, `Dinosaur_3`, `Horse _27`, etc.**
* The `[Type]` needs to be exactly as shown in the above type chart (BFAV note below). Spaces and capitalization optional.
* All animals with a baby or sheared sprite MUST have these sprites in the folder, alongside the normal adult sprite.
* Each baby or sheared skin is matched to the normal adult version of the skin with that ID (i.e. `babysheep_1` will be the baby sprite of a sheep with the skin `sheep_1`)
* Skin IDs can be any number greater than 1, but must be unique from others of that type (i.e. you can have `dog_1` and `whitechicken_1`, but not two `whitechicken_1`s)
* **BFAV animal skins are to be named in the same way**, with their name looking the same as it appears in the BFAV `Config` file. **Double check the `Config`,** as animals may have a variety of "color variants" (like whitechicken and brownchicken have), which all need their own skin sets.
* All sprite files must be of type `.PNG` or `.XNB`
* All sprite files must be placed in `AdoptSkin/assets/skins`


# BFAV Compatibility

BFAV-added animals must have their skin files named in the same format as other farm animals/pets/horses, with the type from the chart above instead being the name as it is written in the BFAV `Config` file.

**ADDITIONAL BFAV NOTE:**
If you're using a BFAV animal with color variants and would like the functionality of additional custom sprites that A&S adds, note that you will have to do the whole skin set for *each* color variant.
I.E. Say BFAV adds a `RedSeagull` and a `BlueSeagull`. If you want them both to rotate through the same three skins, you will have to make your three skin files say `blueseagull_1`, `blueseagull_2`, and `blueseagull_3`, alongside any baby/sheared sprites, and then copy these skins and rename them to have an identical set that is `redseagull_1`, `redseagull_2`, `redseagull_3`, etc.

If you know what you're doing (a.k.a I am not user support for BFAV, and am also not responsible for broken code) then you can make a new animal class of just "seagull".

# FAQ

**Does the horse whistle work with the tractor mod?**
> Yep.

**Can I turn off/change X feature?**
> Check the `Config` file. There's a ton of things you can turn on and off or set to a different value. Explanations of the options in the `Config` are described below.

**Can I change/rename/delete/add to folders inside of `/assets/skins`?**
> Yep! Any subfolder of the `/skins` folder is purely serving as a visual means to organize! You can do whatever you like to them, and nest folders to your heart's content; A&S will grab any skin inside. Just make sure you're still naming everything the same- A&S doesn't care *what* folder you put them in.

**Where's the `Config` file?**
> The `Config` file will generate after you've run Stardew Valley at least once after installing A&S.

**The SMAPI commands aren't working!**
> The commands went through an overhaul with the release of 2.4.0, and again with 2.6.0. If you're used to the old commands, or are confused on how to use them in general, refer to the explanations and example of the commands below.

**Why aren't the skins showing up? / I'm getting an error and skins aren't showing up**
> **First**, make sure that you've placed skins in `AdoptSkin/assets/skins`, as A&S does not come with many skins of its own- only a few example skins.

> **Second**, check the file naming guide below.

> **Third**, Make sure you don't have any other skin replacers for animals, pets, or horses. If you do:

> 1. Since reskinners can cause conflict, you'll have to make sure you've moved any skins that you want from those mods into `AdoptSkin/assets/skins`
> 2. Remove the reskin mods from the `Mods` folder
> 3. When you load older saves that used these replacers, call `randomize_skin` on the creatures or creature category that was using those skins

> Those creatures, and new ones of its kind, should be good to go after that!

> **Fourth**, if you're still having problems or are confused, feel free to post a comment or ask on the SDV discord's modding channel!

**Why aren't my BFAV animal skins working?**
> Make sure the skins are named **exactly** as they appear in the BFAV Config file. Some BFAV animals have "color variants", that work just like how brown chickens and white chickens do, in that they're each treated as a completely different animal. You'll have to name skins for each variant.

**Can I use A&S in multiplayer?**
> Conditionally. Multipet/multihorse isn't yet tested in multiplayer, but the farm animal skins work. Other things are a little unpredictable, as they are not yet supported. Multiplayer multipet/multihorse is currently being worked on.

**Can I reskin the petbed at Marnie's?**
> Sure can. Just make sure your image is named petbed.png and is the same size as the one in `AdoptSkin/assets`. Then just replace that image with yours!

**The game crashes when I enter Marnie's**
> If you removed `petbed.png`, this is the culprit. You can replace the image with something else, but it has to be there!

**My pet/horse turns invisible when I reskin it**
> This can happen for some users when in fullscreen mode and pulling SMAPI over the top of the game. However, this also can be from a corrupted game problem, due to mods other than A&S. Try these steps to fix the issue, and feel free to ping me (@gathouria#9832) on the SDV #modding server if the issue continues.
> 
> 1. Make a copy of your `Mods` folder somewhere else on your computer (i.e. your Desktop)
> 2. Delete your Stardew Valley folder. Yes, the entire folder. No saved data will be lost, as not only does Steam back your save files up, but they're located in other location on your computer.
> 3. Open up Steam. In your library, right click on Stardew Valley, and select `Properties`. Select the `Local Files` tab, and click `Verify Integrity of Game Files`. Steam will then alert you that your files are missing, and then redownload Stardew Valley for you. The reason for deleting the entire folder instead of just validating files is due to the fact that Steam cannot detect many corruptions of files, and reacquiring ensures that your files are Stardew-original.
> 4. Run Stardew Valley. You can close this as soon as it opens.
> 5. Reinstall SMAPI.
> 6. Create a new `Mods` folder within your Stardew Valley folder, and ONLY move Adopt & Skin into it.
> 7. Check that the issue still occurs on a new save file. You can use [CJB Cheats Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4) and [CJB Item Spawner](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/93) to quickly get to owning a pet or having a stable, as they have always worked fine for my personal testing. The save that you encountered the issue on may or may not continue to have the issue, as Stardew made the file while it was corrupted.
> 8. If the issue is fixed, move your `Mods` folder back into the Stardew Valley folder, and check that the issue doesn't reoccur by again making a new save file. If it does, then the issue is coming from a conflict with another mod. Make sure that none of the known incompatible mods, listed near the beginning of this page, are also installed.

**My horse isn't showing up when I call `list_creatures horse`**
> Make sure that you are not currently riding your horse. Stardew Valley's code removes a horse from all existence when it is being ridden, and re-adds it to existence when it is dismounted. When your horse doesn't exist, A&S will not list it for you, as you cannot reskin it at that time.

> This also seems to be an issue in some multiplayer games. Reminder that **multiplayer is not yet tested for A&S, and there are likely many bugs.**

**I don't see any stray pets at Marnie's!**
> Strays only start appearing the day after you've received your first pet from Marnie in-game, and don't appear every day. The chance of them appearing can be altered in the `Config` file.

> There is also a known bug that happens when you return to the title screen and load a save file again, without exiting to desktop, that causes Strays to not appear in Marnie's, or to be invisible at Marnie's, even if a notification is given that one should be there. This is fixed by just exiting Stardew and reloading the game.

**I can't find any wild horses!**
> Wild horses will only appear after you've built a stable, and are somewhat uncommon, having about a 25% chance to appear somewhere on the map each day, give or take some luck. This choice was made in order for wild horses to be an exciting find, rather than something you get bored of running across. That said, you can increase the chance of one appearing or set the chat and console to notify you when and where a wild horse appears via the `Config` file.

**I see a wild horse but can't reach it??**
> Tricky little devils, aren't they

# Console Commands

**`list_creatures [creature category]`**

Gives the Name, ID, and skin ID of every creature in the given category

*Accepted categories: all, animal, pet, horse, coop, barn, chicken, cow, or any specific type (i.e. whitechicken)*

**`randomize_skin [creature category or creature ID]`**

Randomizes the skin of the creatures with the given category or the creature with the given ID

*Accepted categories: all, animal, pet, horse, coop, barn, chicken, cow, or any specific type (i.e. whitechicken)*

**`set_skin [skin ID] [creature ID]`**

Select a specific skin for the given creature

**`sell [creature ID]`**

Gives away the specific pet or horse with the given creature ID

**`horse_whistle [optional: horse ID]`**

Calls a horse to your location. When used with a horse's ID, that specific horse is called. This also has a configurable hotkey, which is "R" by default.

**`corral_horses`**

Sends all the horses you own to your stable, giving you the honor of being a professional clown car chauffeur. This also has a configurable hotkey, which is "Y" by default.


## *Command Example:*

Let's set our chicken, who we'll call Chirpchirp, to have the skin `whitechicken_4`, which we've placed in the `/assets/skins` folder of A&S.

First, we'll need to figure out Chirpchirp's ID, which the the short number A&S uses to reference individual farm animals, pets, and horses.
To do that, we'll call `list_creatures chicken` in the SMAPI console. The output should show all the chickens you own. Chirpchirp's information should look something like this:

**`# Chirpchirp: Type - whitechicken`**

**`Short ID: 3`**

**`Skin ID:  9`**

From this we can tell that Chirpchirp's farm animal ID is 3, and it's currently set to have the `whitechicken` type skin 9, which would be the skin named `whitechicken_9` in the `/assets/skins` folder.

To set Chirpchirp's skin to `whitechicken_4`, we then need to call `set_skin 4 3`, which calls the `set_skin` function on the creature with the ID of 3 (which happens to be Chirpchirp) and gives it the fourth skin of that creature's type (Chirpchirp is a `whitechicken`, so that's the skin named `whitechicken_4`).

Chirpchirp will now appear with the skin `whitechicken_4`!
